            <p>
                Strip foundation which is also called as strip footing which is sub 
                category of shallow foundation are use to provide continuous level or 
                stepped strip of support to a linear structure for example walls or 
                closely spaced rows or columns built in centre above them. Strip 
                foundations can be done in mostly all sub soils, but a soil of good 
                bearing capacity is suitable. This type of foundation is generally 
                used for the construction of medium or low rise domestic buildings.
            </p>
            <p>
                The underside of strip footing should be deep so that frost action 
                does not take place. The position and size of strip foundation 
                depends upon the overall width of the wall. The old or traditional 
                strip foundation is basically equal or greater than overall wall 
                width and also the foundation width is three times the width of the 
                supported wall.

                <li>Ability to withstand great loads.</li>
                <li>They have subtypes from which you can choose the one you need for particular purposes.</li>
                <li>The price is much lower than that of cast-in-situ structures, although strip foundations are not inferior to them in strength.</li>
                <li>Easy to build, no special training requirements for personnel.</li>
                <li>Very long service life.</li>
                <li>You can insulate the floors much better if you use a strip foundation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantages of Strip Foundation</h3>

                <li>Not suitable for every soil type.li>
                <li>You have to do the filling on a single go and the amount of material to prepare for filling is a problem.</li>
                <li>It is only suitable in low rise buildings.</li>
            </ul>
