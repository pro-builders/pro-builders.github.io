            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Construction is a very oldest human activity. Knowledge of deep founding was 
                possessed more than 12000 years ago in Switzerland by Neolithic inhabitants. 
                They constructed their home on a long wooden piles, high above dangerous animals 
                and hostile neighbors driven into the soft bottoms of shallow lakes. Many years later,
                the Babylonians which are found on the deep alluvium settled themselves under the weight 
                of the construction. Biggest development in foundation engineering took place in ancient Rome, 
                where certain rules were imposed and pozzolanic concrete was used. In later years many buildings 
                collapsed because of wars earthquakes and natural calamities and those which survived suffer from 
                cracks and other problems. From that period it became very important to have strong foundation.
            </p>

                Construction of any structure starts with the built up of foundation base which 
                holds the weight of all beams, columns, walls, slab, and other household materials. 
                Hence having a strong and solid base is must. Foundation is basically classified into two major 
                category which is further sub divided into number of categories based on the type of structure to 
                be implemented. For low rise houses and bungalows shallow foundation is used and for high rise 
                building and houses deep foundation is used. The classification diagram is shown below for better 
                understanding of the types of foundation. Every foundation has different type of footing. Not only on 
                ground but underground foundation is also exists which has a total different type of construction 
                methodology. Each foundation type has a unique equation which helps us to design the foundation on 
                field. For some foundation the underground depth is 3m while for some the underground depth is 10m 
                and more as it depends upon the height of the structure. Also a thorough understanding of ground 
                and soil condition is must for construction of foundation as it plays a major role in understanding 
                the behavior of the structure, which materials should be used and also will the structure stand firm 
                for longer time or not. So before constructing any foundation it is very important to study the soil 
                type of the ground and also to check if the area is an earthquake prone zone or not.

            <h3>Types of Foundation</h3>
            <p>Foundation is basically classified into two major types such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a class="dec" href="/shallow.html">Shallow Foundation</a></li>
                <li><a class="dec" href="/deep.html">Deep Foundation</a></li>
            </ul>
