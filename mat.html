            <h1>Mat or Raft Foundation</h1>
            <p>
                Mat or raft foundation is a continuous slap resting on the soil that 
                extends over an entire footprint of the building, thus supporting the 
                building the building and transferring its weight to the ground. Mat 
                or raft footing is basically a thick concrete slab reinforced with 
                steel that covers the entire contact area of the structure like a 
                thick floor. They are large concrete slabs which supports a number 
                of walls and columns. In this the foundations are constructed by 
                excavating soil in order to compact, strong, undisturbed natural soil 
                which is at least a few feetâ€™s below the ground level. This soil is 
                stronger as compared to the loose soil at the surface hence it is 
                very good for basements. Raft or mat foundation is required in areas 
                where soil has to support heavy structural loads and has low bearing 
                capacity.

            <h3>Advantages of Mat or Raft Foundation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It can be constructed in poor soil condition.</li>
                <li>It resists differential settlement.</li>
                <li>It distributes load over a larger area.</li>
                <li>It requires less earth excavation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantages of Mat or Raft Foundation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It is prone to edge erosion.</li>
                <li>When subjected to concentrated load it requires special measurements.</li>
            </ul>
