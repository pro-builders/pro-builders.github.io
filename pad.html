            <p>
                Pad foundation is a sub category of shallow foundation which settles 
                and spreads over the soil safely. If the soil at the site has 
                sufficient strength and is not too deep them Pad foundation is 
                preferred. Thickness of pad foundation is generally uniform. Pad 
                foundation spreads safely over the concentrated load to the bearing 
                stratum. Hence the design of the foundation should be stiff so that 
                uniform spreading of load to the soil takes place without making the 
                foundation pressure exceed the permissible bearing stress. This is 
                achieved by making the pad deep or by reinforcing the pad as both the 
                techniques helps to spread the force in a predefined angle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The angle of spreading is calculated by the bearing capacity of the 
                underlying soil and concrete strength. Size of the pad should be 
                design such that the tension inside the concrete should be prevented; 
                as a result no cracking will take place which will result in failure. 
                The arrangement of pad foundation mainly depends on load bearing 
                capacity of the soil, available space, imposed loads and the structure 
                to be supported. Materials that can be used in pad foundation are 
                reinforcement and cast in â€“ situ concrete (OPC or SRPC).

            <h3>Advantages of Pad Foundation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Can be designed to accommodate tight sites</li>
                <li>Reinforcement for tension and shear can be added.</li>
                <li>Economic due to control of foundation size.</li>
                <li>Shallow form of foundation needs little excavation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantages of Pad Foundation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Foundation size can be a very large to cope with high point loads.</li>
                <li>Limited foundation suitability to point loads of framed buildings.</li>
                <li>Separate foundations make this design weak against differential settlement that may affect the building.</li>
                <li>Deep excavations for foundations would require support to prevent caving in.</li>
                <li>Weak against uplift forces, wind forces and earthquake forces.</li>
            </ul>
