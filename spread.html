            <h1>Spread Footing Foundation</h1>
            <p>
                Spread footing is generally used in residential building, has a wider 
                bottom portion as compared to the load bearing foundation walls it 
                supports. This wider bottom portion spreads the weight of the 
                structure over more area to achieve more stability. The layout and 
                design of the spread footing foundation is controlled by some factors, 
                such as the weight of the superstructure it must support, penetration 
                of soft near surface layers and penetration through near surface layers 
                which are likely to change volume due to shrink swell or frost heave.
            </p>
            <p>
                This type of footing is basically used to construct basements in residential 
                buildings. Spread footing behaves like an inverted cantilever with load applied 
                in the upward direction. Builders and civil engineers prefer spread footing as 
                it beneficial, as it helps transfer the load to the ground surface making it 
                an excellent solution for stabilizing weak soil. Benefits of spread footing are 
                it reduces the cracking caused by settlement, cost efficient in design, 
                construction and quality control, and stabilize the soil around the structural 
                base, less complicated procedure.

                Spread footing is further divided into two sub categories such as:
