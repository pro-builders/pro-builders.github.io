            <h1>Strap Foundation</h1>
            <p>
                Strap footing is also known as cantilever footing. When two columns 
                having independent footing base, connected by a beam is called as 
                strap foundation. Strap footing consists two or more columns footing 
                connected by concrete beam. Such type of footing distributes the load 
                of heavy or eccentrically loaded column footing to adjacent footing. 
                Strap footing works as a conjunction with columns which are located 
                along builderâ€™s property line or lot line. Main benefit of using strap 
                footing is it gives extra stability to the footing by sharing of loads. 
                Strap footing can also be used in soft soil as it avoids the sinking 
                of an individual footing. In strap footing the strap is attached to the 
                footing and column by the use of dowels in such a way that the footing 
                and the strap act as unit. The footing is subjected to one way end.
